Project Overview
---------------------------------------------------
*This application is currently under development and can be accessed through a web browser. You can preview the application by opening one of the HTML pages directly in your browser or by setting up a local development environment using Visual Studio Code.

Getting Started
-------------------
Prerequisites
-------------------
Install Visual Studio Code - This will serve as your code editor and development environment.

Add the "Live Server" Plugin - Once Visual Studio Code is installed, search for the Live Server extension in the Extensions panel and install it. 

This plugin enables live reloading, allowing you to view updates to your HTML pages in real time.

Steps to Run the Application
-------------------------------
Clone or Download the Application Folder - Ensure you have the full project folder on your local device.

Open the Folder in Visual Studio Code:

Launch Visual Studio Code.

Open the application folder by navigating to File > Open Folder and selecting your project directory.

Start Live Server:
------------------
With the folder open in Visual Studio Code, right-click on the index.html (or your main HTML file) and select Open with Live Server.

This will open the application in your default web browser, and any changes made in Visual Studio Code will automatically refresh in the browser.

Now youâ€™re ready to explore the application as development progresses!
